  <h2>EFFECTS OF DISPOSABLE PADS</H2>
  Disposal pads cause irritation and infection on ones body because they are made of plastic.
  Another effect of disposal pads they cause cancer, yes because one is using them every month and yet are made of plastics<br>
  They also contain pesticides and herbicides. We all knoe that pads are made of cotton crops being sprayed with pesticidesand herbicides<br>
  They can also definitely cause harm when they reach blood strea. They contain dioxin, an environmental pollutant which is not natural<br>
